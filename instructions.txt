# Instructions

## Basic Guidelines
You are required to code the sample page given to you, by hand, from scratch - not using a pagebuilder or visual design software. Here you have been given all the files and information you need in order to reproduce the layout. 

Try not to rush. Speed is good, but *accuracy* and *tidyness* are much more important. The closer you get to the intended design, the better. It is also extremely important to keep your code 'tidy': organised, well-structured, and readable. 

If you need more information, ask. 

## General Exercise Information 
The layout uses 3 colours only:

@purple: #310C3D
@orange: #F18805
@yellow: #E8BF2E

It uses an open source font called 'Alegreya', which you can find in the Google Fonts library, here:

https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alegreya

You **must** use the required font and required colours in your stylesheet.

The layout uses a few images, which have been provided as part of the exercise. You **must** use the provided images, as required in the layout.

You must code a RESPONSIVE layout, using appropriate _@media_ queries in your stylesheet. In order to see how the layout should change when going from mobile to desktop, you have been provided 2 versions of the same page - the 'mobile' version, and the 'desktop' version. 

The layout has a few interactive elements - buttons and form fields. To see how these elements should be styled on different states - e.g., when the cursor is hovering over them, or when they are being clicked - see the 'interactivity' page.

## Hero Banner - Top Purple Section
The first section at the top of the page is the 'Hero Banner'. It has a Main Heading, a Sub-heading, and a call-to-action button. The requirements here are:
- the hero section should always take up the full height of the viewport - ie., it should always fill up the full window with the purple background
- the 3 elements - Main Heading, Sub-heading and call-to-action - should always be vertically and horizontally centered in the Hero
- clicking the 'contact us' button should scroll the page down to the 'Contact Us' section
- regardless of how much text there is in the Main Heading or Sub-heading, the text blocks should have a maximum width of 550px, and there should always be at least a 15px margin between the text and the sides of the window.

Helpful specs:
- font size of Main Heading is 36px 
- font size of Sub-heading is 18px
- font size of button text is 14px, and font weight is Extra Bold

## 'Info' Section - Orange Section
The 'Info' section has an featured image, a block of text, and a 'down' button - a yellow triangle at the bottom of the section. On mobile, the featured image, the text and the button appear on a single column, on top of each other. On desktop, the block of text and the featured image appear side-by-side, on a 2-column layout. Regardless of how wide the browser window is, the 2-column layout of the text and image together should never be wider than 640px. 

Helpful specs:
- Section heading text is Alegreya Extra Bold, 28px
- Body text is Alegreya Regular, 18px
- Image border is 4px thick, with a radius of 50px

## Contact Section - Yellow Section
The Contact section contains a block of text, and a contact form. It also shows a semi-transparent image in the background. On mobile, the image is aligned at the bottom of the section, and takes up about 70% of the full width of the screen. On desktop, it is aligned to the left, and takes up about 40% of the entire screen width.

Helpful specs:
- Font size and weight of section heading and body text are the same as in 'Info' section
- Form fields use Alegreya Regular, 18px. Placeholder text is 40% transparent.
- Form fields have a 1px orange border, and an orange background set to 25% transparent.
- Font of 'Send' button is 14px Alegreya Extra Bold - same as the call-to-action in the hero section

The form does NOT have to be functional for the purposes of this exercise - ie., clicking 'Send' doesn't have to do anything. We just need to make the fields interactive - ie., change appearance when hovered and clicked on. 

## Footer
The footer uses a tiled, semi-transparent background image. It has one single line of text, which should be centered on desktop, and left-aligned on mobile. The text is set in 12px Alegreya Medium, and has a 6px yellow drop-shadow.

## Minimum Requirements
You are expected to code and style your page using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. It is possible to complete the entire exercise using only HTML+CSS, but if you'd like to add extra effects or inteactivity by using Javascript, you are welcome to do so.

You are welcome to program using 'vanilla' HTML/CSS, but you will get extra points if you are able to use pre-processor languages such as Pug, LESS or SASS/SCSS.

## Frameworks
You are expected to code this page _without_ using a framework such as Bootstrap, Foundation, Bulma or Semantic UI. If, however, you do want to use a framework, you are allowed to use UIkit (http://getuikit.com) - and proficient use of UIkit will also give you extra marks.
